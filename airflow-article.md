##This was very fruitful internship where I created two projects that can will be useful and can be deployed with more time. 
One of the projects is generalizing the task building process in airflow. Highlighted below is a timeline with specific detail as to what was accomplished. 


First week:
 
I was instructed to get myself familiar with airflow. Learning from previous projects, I quickly made my way to the documentation, as that is the only way to get the best and most complete understanding of what the program is.  I learned the different commands there were and then jumped on over to docker for production use.
